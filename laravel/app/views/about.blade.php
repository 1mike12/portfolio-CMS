        <h1>About Myself</h1>
        <p>Sampling my projects, I may come off as a proverbial jack of all trades (and master of none). I admit my interests seem haphazard on the surface. However, the common thread behind everything is my hard work and passionate pursuit of combining the technical with the artistic. I learn fast, especially when it is both technical and artistic. My wide educational, experiential and personal perspectives are my greatest strengths and inform everything that I do.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <div class="gradientLine"></div>
        <p>Continuing the unconventional narrative, my college education put me in 4 different schools. In fact, I started out in electrical engineering and failed out of an elite school my first year. It was an extremely important event that helped awaken my own understanding of my passions.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I learned the habit of working hard and pursued my passion for business at Bentley Univeristy, graduating Cum Laude in 2 years.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <div class="gradientLine"></div>
        <p>I enjoy learning new skills and often find myself independently studying, especially when I was in school. Most of my knowledge of digital design and programming is self-taught. I have entrepreneurial experience in several startups. One of my motivations for learning programming came from the constant lack of developers on projects.</p>
        <p>Ever since setting off on the development path, I have done work for several companies and launched two serious projects. One is a math tool called matrix translator and the other is this portfolio itself. You can see them on the <a href="{{URL::to("project-list")}}">project list</a> page.
